.. _CONFIGURATION:

==================
Configuration
==================

For any activity, GraphRepo uses a yaml (.yml) configuration with 2 objects:

* a Neo4j instance configuration, and
* a repository configuration,

as follows::

    neo:
      db_url: localhost # the url for the Neo4j database
      port: 7687 # the Neo4j port
      db_user: neo4j # Neo4j authentication username
      db_pwd: neo4jj # Neo4j authentication password
      batch_size: 100 # the batch size for inserting the records in Neo4j - this setting depends on the Neo4j resources

    project:
      repo: "repos/graphrepo/" # the repository filepath
      start_date: "1 February, 2018" # the start date for indexing (leave empty if it corresponds with the initial start date of the project)
      end_date: "30 March, 2018" # the start date for indexing (leave empty if it corresponds with the last commit)
      project_id: "graphrepo" # a unique project id for the database
      index_code: False # boolean, if True GraphRepo indexes for each file touched by a commit the source code before and after the commit. This parameter significantly increases the index time and the hardware resources needed for Neo4j. For a medium size project, with 4000 commits, with an average of 1 file edited/commit, the equivalent of 8000 files will be stored in text in Neo4j if this parameter is set to True.
      index_developer_email: True # boolean, if True, GraphRepo indexes the developer emails in the Developer node. Turn flag off for GDPR or any other privacy concerns



Neo4j configuration
====================

GraphRepo connects to Neo4j using the Bolt driver from `py2neo <https://py2neo.org/>`_.
Currently the only attributes needed to connect to Neo4j are the url+port and the authentication credentials.
All other configurations (e.g., setting the user permissions) are done on the database side.


Repository configuration
========================

In order to insert a repository in the database, it has to be cloned on the local machine (where GraphRepo will run).
Afterwards, it can be linked with GraphRepo using the ``project.repo`` attribute in the config file.

If one does not want to use all the repository data (e.g., if the repository is very large), it can configure
the index dates using the ``project.start_date`` and ``project.end_date`` attributes.

The ``project.project_id`` attribute is used to give each project a unique identifier.
Currently, GraphRepo indexes all repositories in the same database, in order to allow information about teams of developers that work
on distinct projects to be mined without merging databases.


The ``project.index_code`` attribute decides if GraphRepo indexes, for each file touched by a commit, the source code before and after the commit.
This parameter significantly increases the index time and the hardware resources needed for Neo4j.
For a medium size project, with 4000 commits, with an average of 1 file edited/commit, the equivalent of 8000 files will be stored in text in Neo4j if this parameter is set to True.
